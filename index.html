                    <p align="justify">I,<strong> Sunil Raj Ramchandani </strong> was born in Jaipur India on September 11, 1994. Although I enjoyed it in India I was forced by my parents to migrate to Philippines, my mother’s home country, to take care of the properties residing there. At first it was hellish for me due to the fact that my whole family is not with me but soon enough I embraced the country's culture and people making them my family. And look at me now! I am more patriotic than most when it comes to appreciating the country, half Filipino by blood but full blooded Pinoy in heart and spirit. <br/> <br/>

                        Like most people, I like those things in which I find pleasure. One of the few things that brings happiness in my life is playing with my four-pawed best friends, which keep my mood fresh and lit. I am taking care of 8 dogs in which I love equally, directly quoting myself, “Sila na nag palaki sakin eh, kaya kahit saang adventure ko sa buhay basta pwede, kasama ko sila”. I try to learn as many as possible whether it is General Knowledge, Science and Technology at times even MATH because I find learning to be refreshing and it helps me de-stress. Another hobby that pleases me is listening to people’s opinions, problem or anything that is shareable wordwise, but I am not fond of telling others my personal opinions and/or feelings to avoid, as much as possible, confrontations. I try to be as invisible as much as possible to avoid unnecessary human contacts because I highly dislike wasting my time doing/speaking of things that will not end up fruitful in the future. <br/> <br/>

                        I am a simple living kind of guy that enjoys the company of my dogs, I love to study because I know that all that knowledge will be useful sometime in the future. Even though I try to be polite all the time a dark-side at time pops-out whenever someone is wasting my time so it is highly recommended to avoid me if you have nothing good to say.
